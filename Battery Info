According to ChatGPT, our estimated weight (350 lbs), desired speed (25 mph), and desired time at max speed (25 mph for 45 mins at full charge) will require a battery with at least 780 Wh (watt-hours).

With the motor and other additions we plan on adding, we will likely need a battery with about 48V in order to power everything adequately.
As of now, it appears we will be using a 24V, 1/4 horsepower motor, which (according to ChatGPT) will require roughly 185 Wh, which should be sufficient.

For the Ah (amp-hours), there is no necessary number. However, the more amp-hours the battery has the better as it will provide more range for the bike.

With the frame we currently plan on using, the battery should fit perfectly in the middle of the frame.

For what we need, most of the batteries available will be roughly between $200-$500. It may be slightly cheaper to build a battery with cells, but the difference (if there is any) is not worth it for the risk and effort required.

The exact battery we will use depends on exactly what motor we choose, the gears we use, and other additions made to the bike, however this should be a good estimation.
