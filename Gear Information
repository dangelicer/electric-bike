Gear Information
---------------------------------------------------

Background Information:
-Speed: 30 mph (13.41 m/s)
-Mass: 350 lbs (158.76 kg)
-Acceleration (from 0-30 mph within 10 seconds): 1.341 m/s^2
-Force: 212.98 N

Calculating required torque requires the radius of the wheel we will be using.


Various Torques of Varying Radii: 

R(8in/0.203m) (very small tire, potentially minibike) = 43.235 N*m of Torque
R(11in/0.279m) (smaller bike tire) = 59.421 N*m of Torque
R(15in/0.381m) (larger bike tire) = 81.145 N*m of Torque
R(17in/0.432m) (massive tire, just for options) = 92.007 N*m of Torque


Other Information:
------------------
Gear Ratios - Affects torque applied to an object from a torque source using different teeth counts and gear radi.
Higher Gear Ratio - A larger driven gear than the driving gear (gear connected to the motor) results in a higher torque output, but a slower rotational speed for the driven gear. (ideal for hills or starting from a stop)
Lower Gear Ratio - A smaller driven gear than the driving gear results in a higher rotational speed but less torque for the driven gear (ideal for highspeed applications)

Gears and Bikes:
Higher Gear (lower gear ratio) (Harder to pedal) means larger driving gear, and smaller driven gear. Provides LESS torque but more rotational speed.
Smaller Gear (higher gear ratio) (Easier to pedal) means smaller driving gear, and larger driven gear. Provides MORE torque but less rotational speed. 


Recommended gear configuration:
Higher gear ratio (small driving gear to big driven gear), we may sacrifice speed but it would ensure the bike is able to run with a load (esp max load) at all, due to the torque increase.


Conclusions:
For city commuting or flat terrain: A motor with a moderate torque level (50-80 Nm) and higher speed focus is likely sufficient.


Estimated cost of motor:
Between $100-200
